<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>
在线社区包括来自许多不同背景的人。 Go 贡献者致力于为所有人提供友好、安全和热情的环境，无论性别认同和表达、性取向、残疾、神经多样性、外貌、体型、民族、国籍、种族、年龄、宗教或类似的个人特征。
</p>

<p>
行为准则的第一个目标是指定行为的基线标准，以便具有不同社会价值观和沟通方式的人们可以有效、富有成效和尊重地谈论围棋。
</p>

<p>
第二个目标是提供一种机制来解决社区中出现的冲突。
</p>

<p>
行为准则的第三个目标是让我们的社区欢迎来自不同背景的人。多样性对项目至关重要； Go 要取得成功，它需要来自不同背景的贡献者和用户。
(参见 <a href="https://blog.golang.org/open-source">Go，开源，社区</a>.)
</p>

<p>
我们相信健康的辩论和分歧对于健康的项目和社区至关重要。
然而，不尊重永远是不对的。
我们重视不同的意见，但我们更重视尊重的行为。
</p>

<h2 id="values">Gopher 价值观</h2>

<p>
这些是 Go 社区中的人们（“Gophers”）应该追求的价值观。
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>友好而热情。</b>
<li><b>要有耐心。</b>
    <ul>
    <li>请记住，人们的交流方式各不相同，并不是每个人都使用自己的母语。
        (翻译中可能会丢失意义和语气。)
    </ul>
<li><b>要深思熟虑。</b>
    <ul>
    <li>富有成效的沟通需要努力。
        想想你的话将如何被解释。
    <li>请记住，有时最好完全避免发表评论。
    </ul>
<li><b>尊重。</b>
    <ul>
    <li>尤其要尊重意见分歧。
    </ul>
<li><b>做慈善。</b>
    <ul>
    <li>真诚地解释他人的论点，不要寻求不同意见。
    <li>当我们不同意时，试着去理解为什么。
    </ul>
<li><b>要有建设性。</b>
    <ul>
    <li>避免脱轨：保持主题；如果您想谈论其他事情，请开始新的对话。
    <li>避免非建设性的批评：不要仅仅谴责当前的事态；提供——或至少征求——关于如何改进事情的建议。
    <li>避免咆哮（精辟、低效、狙击评论）
    <li>避免讨论潜在的冒犯性或敏感问题；这往往导致不必要的冲突。
    <li>避免微攻击（简短而常见的口头、行为和环境侮辱，向个人或团体传达敌意、贬损或负面的轻视和侮辱）。
    </ul>
<li><b>要负责任。</b>
    <ul>
    <li>你说的和做的很重要。
        对您的言行负责，包括其后果，无论是有意还是无意。
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>
人很复杂。
You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others;
when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame.
Try not to take offense where no offense was intended.
Give people the benefit of the doubt.
Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it.
It is the responsibility of <i>all parties</i> to de-escalate conflict when it arises.
</p>

<h2 id="code">Code of Conduct</h2>

<h3 id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</h3>

<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>

<h3 id="our-standards">Our Standards</h3>

<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
<li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
<li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
<li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
<li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances</li>
<li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
<li>Public or private harassment</li>
<li>Publishing others&rsquo; private information, such as a physical or electronic
address, without explicit permission</li>
<li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="our-responsibilities">Our Responsibilities</h3>

<p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>

<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.</p>

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>

<p>This Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when the Project
Stewards have a reasonable belief that an individual&rsquo;s behavior may have a
negative impact on the project or its community.</p>

<h3 id="conflict-resolution"></a>Conflict Resolution</h3>

<p>We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement
often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or
to engage in behavior that violates the project’s code of conduct.</p>

<p>If you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address
the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly
and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their
dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the
behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing
an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.</p>

<p id="reporting">Reports should be directed to the
Go Project Stewards at <i>conduct@golang.org</i>.
It is the Project Stewards’ duty to
receive and address reported violations of the code of conduct. They will then
work with a committee consisting of representatives from the Open Source
Programs Office and the Google Open Source Strategy team. If for any reason you
are uncomfortable reaching out to the Project Stewards, please email
the Google Open Source Programs Office at <i>opensource@google.com</i>.</p>

<p>We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response.
We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported
incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from
the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the
report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken.
The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report
supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing
harassment or threats to anyone&rsquo;s safety, we may take action without notice.</p>

<li>Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
